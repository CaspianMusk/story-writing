Sir William and the Witch's Curse is the title of the play.

     Act 1: 
         Scene 1:
         
             (In a stately room. King Henry is seated on his throne, with Sir William beside him.)    Sir William, my devoted Knight, you have served me honorably and heroically for many years.    Sir William says: It is my duty and honor to serve you, my liege.    (Sighing) Our kingdom has been at peace for far too long. Something dreadful is about to happen, I'm afraid.    Sir William: (Alert) What is bothering you, my king?    (King Henry frowns) A witch has emerged in our realm. She causes trouble wherever she goes. I am concerned about our people's safety.    Sir William: (Fiercely determined) My lord, I shall not rest until I have ended this witch's wickedness.    Sir William, I knew I could trust you, King Henry. But be cautious since this witch is not to be trifled with. She is astute and deadly.    Sir William: (Nodding) My lord, I will be cautious.    
       
         Scene 2:
         
             (In front of the palace gates. Sir William is getting ready to embark on his adventure. His squire, John, is assisting him.)    Sir William, are you sure you want to do this, Sir John? The forbidden woodland is a hazardous location.    Sir William: (Confidently) Do not be alarmed, John. My name is Knight. It is my responsibility to defend the kingdom and its people.    John: (Sighing) All right, sir. Just be cautious, and God bless you.    Sir William: (Smiles) Thank you very much, John. I'll be back as soon as I can.    (The scene shifts to Sir William going through the forest.)    Sir William: (To himself) The forest is foreboding, but I must proceed. Our kingdom's fate is on my shoulders.    (Eerie noises can be heard as Sir William ventures farther into the woodland. Sir William, on the other hand, remains steadfast in his pursuit of his aim.)    
       
     In Act 1, the characters of King Henry and Sir William are established through their dialogues and actions. The threat posed by the witch, Hecate, is introduced, and the curse she placed on King Henry is revealed. Sir William sets out on a journey to find a mystical herb that can break the curse and save the king's life.
       
             
     Act 2:    
         Scene 1:
         
             (A forbidden forest. Sir William is deep in the woods, looking for the herb that can heal King Henry.)    Sir William: (To himself) The woodland is dangerous, but I must focus. I need to locate the herb that will save our king.    (A huge spider leaps before Sir William, blocking his progress.)    Sir William: (drawing his sword) Keep your distance, vile beast!    (The spider attacks Sir William, but he avoids its attacks and kills it.)    Sir William: (heavy breathing) That was close. I need to be more cautious.    (As Sir William continues his trip, he encounters frightening creatures, such as a snake and a dragon. With his sword and valor, he beats them all.)
                 
         Scene 2:
         
             (A wooded clearing. Sir William has finally discovered the herb he has been looking for.)    Sir William: (Picking up the herb) I've finally discovered it! Today I have to return to the kingdom.    (Suddenly, Hecate and her followers appear, encircling Sir William.)    Hecate: (Smirking) Did you think you could beat me, Knight? You are no match for my abilities.    Sir William: (Fiercely) I will never, ever submit to the likes of you, witch!    (He pulls his sword and battles Hecate and her minions, but they are outnumbered.)    Sir William: (Weakening) I can't keep on much longer.    (Just as Hecate is about to give the ultimate blow, a swarm of forest dwellers arrives from nowhere and attacks Hecate and her followers from behind.)    Forest Dweller: (Defeating Hecate's followers) We've been watching you, Knight. We've come to assist you in defeating this witch.    Sir William: (Smiles) Thank you very much, my friends! We can overcome her if we work together!    (The scene shifts to Sir William and the woodland dwellers triumphing over Hecate and her followers.)    Hecate: (Defeated) Knight, you may have won this battle, but the war is far from over!    Sir William: (heavy breathing) Get away, witch! Our kingdom will no longer accept your bad activities.    (The scene concludes with Sir William and the forest dwellers triumphant and Hecate and her followers retiring into the forest.)    
             
     Act 2 revolves around Sir William's dangerous journey into the cursed forest to find the mystical herb. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles, including poisonous snakes, giant spiders, and a dragon. He eventually finds the herb but is ambushed by Hecate and her followers. With the help of forest dwellers, Sir William defeats Hecate and her followers, and he returns to the kingdom with the enchanted plant.
     
     Act 3:
        
         Scene 1:     
             (Sir William, the woodland inhabitants, and the king are in the throne room.)    Sir William, my most loyal and valiant Knight, I will be eternally grateful for your heroism. I am eternally grateful that you put your life in danger to save mine.    Sir William: My liege, it was my honor and duty to protect you from any peril, no matter the cost.    King Henry: Your acts have demonstrated that you are more than a knight; you are a true hero. As a result, I've chosen to bestow upon you a new title befitting your valor.    Sir William says: What is your title, my lord?    King Henry: I thus appoint you as Sir William, Protector of the Realm. You will be the kingdom's, its people's, and its future protector.    Sir William: (kneeling) Your grace, my liege, humbles me. I vow to serve and protect this land and its people with all my heart and soul.    (The king lays his hand on Sir William's shoulder, and the forest dwellers applaud.)    
             
         Scene 2:    
         
             (Hecate is alone in her hideout, plotting her revenge.)    Hecate: (speaking to herself) That blasted Sir William may have defeated me, but I shall not be trounced. I have powers beyond his comprehension and shall use them to wreak havoc on this land again. The Protector of the Realm, ha! He shall soon realize that his title is a meaningless symbol of his temporary triumph.    (She cackles and disappears into the shadows.)
                
         Scene 3: 
         
             (Sir William is walking through the kingdom when he hears a scream.)    Sir William: (drawing his sword) What was that?    (He runs towards the sound and finds a young woman being attacked by a group of bandits.)    Sir William: Stand back, fiends! This woman is under the protection of the realm!    (The bandits turn to face him, and a battle ensues.)    Scene 4:    (Sir William has defeated the bandits and is helping the woman to her feet.)    Sir William: Are you alright, madam?    Woman: (sobbing) Yes, thank you, Sir William. I thought I was going to die.    Sir William: Fear not, for I am here to protect you. But what brings you to this part of the kingdom?    Woman: I was on my way to the neighboring village to visit my sick mother. I didn't expect to run into those brigands.    Sir William: (nodding) I see. Well, you shall not be harmed any longer. Allow me to escort you to your mother's village, and I shall ensure you arrive safely.    Woman: (smiling) Thank you, Sir William. You truly are a hero.    (Sir William takes the woman's hand, and they begin to walk toward the village.)   

     Act 3 focuses on the aftermath of Sir William's return to the kingdom with the enchanted plant. The plant saves King Henry's life, and the kingdom returns to a state of tranquility. Sir William is hailed as a hero by the population for his bravery, and his legend spreads far and wide. 
      
     Act 4:    

         Scene 1:

             The Final Battle    (Sir William and the Forest Dwellers are engaged in a fierce battle with Hecate and her followers. Swords clashing, spells flying through the air, and the ground shaking with each blow.)    Sir William: (Swinging his sword at Hecate) "You will not win this battle, witch! Your dark magic will not prevail over our bravery and strength!"    Hecate: (Dodging the blow and cackling) "Foolish Knight! You may have the support of these insignificant forest dwellers, but you cannot defeat the power of my magic!"    (The battle continues, with both sides exchanging blows and spells. The forest dwellers fight bravely, but Hecate's followers are strong and numerous. It seems like all hope is lost.)    Sir William: (Breathless and exhausted) "We can't keep this up forever! We need to find a way to defeat her once and for all!"    (The forest dwellers nod in agreement.)   
             
         Scene 2:
         
             The Triumph of Good    (Sir William suddenly sees a glimmer of light in the distance. He squints his eyes, trying to make out what it is.)    Sir William: "What is that? Over there, in the distance!"    Forest Dweller 1: (Peering in the direction Sir William is pointing) "It's the sun! It's rising!"    (Sir William's eyes widen with realization.)    Sir William: "Of course! The power of Hecate's magic is strongest at night! As the sun rises, her power weakens!"    Hecate: (Hissing in anger) "No! It cannot be!"    (Sir William and the forest dwellers charge forward, taking advantage of Hecate's weakened state. They fight with renewed vigor and determination.)    Sir William: "This is it! We can defeat her now!"    (The battle reaches its climax. Hecate and her followers fight fiercely, but in the end, they are no match for the combined strength of Sir William and the forest dwellers.)    Hecate: (Collapsing to the ground) "Noooooo!"    Sir William: (Standing triumphantly over her) "It's over, witch. Your dark magic has been defeated."    
             
         Scene 3: 
         
             The Aftermath    (The sun has fully risen, and the once-dark forest is now bathed in golden light. Sir William and the forest dwellers stand together, victorious.)    Sir William: "We did it. We defeated Hecate and saved the kingdom."    Forest Dweller 2: "It was an honor to fight alongside you, Sir William."    Sir William: "The honor was mine. I couldn't have done it without all of you."    (Scene fades to black as Sir William and the forest dwellers walk off into the sunlight, leaving Hecate and her followers defeated and alone.)
             
     In Act 4, Sir William remains by King Henry's side, ready to defend the kingdom against any threat that may arise. Hecate is never seen again, and the kingdom remains at peace. Sir William's valorous deeds and heroism ensure that he is remembered as a legend for generations to come.
