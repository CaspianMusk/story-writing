                     "Sir William, my devoted Knight, you have served me honorably and heroically for many years."

                 Sir William:

                      "Our kingdom has been at peace for far too long. Something dreadful is about to happen, I'm afraid."

                 Sir William: (Alert) 
                      
                      "What is bothering you, my king?"

                      "A witch has emerged in our realm. She causes trouble wherever she goes. I am concerned about our people's safety."

                 Sir William: (Fiercely determined)

                      "Sir William, I knew I could trust you. But be cautious since this witch is not to be trifled with. She is astute and deadly."

                 Sir William: (Nodding) 
                      
                      "My lord, I will be cautious."

                 John: 
                     "Sir William, are you sure you want to do this, Sir John? The forbidden woodland is a hazardous location."

                 Sir William: (Confidently) 
                     "Do not be alarmed, John. My name is Knight. It is my responsibility to defend the kingdom and its people."

                 John: (Sighing) 
                     "All right, sir. Just be cautious, and God bless you."

                 Sir William: (Smiling) 
                     "Thank you very much, John. I'll be back as soon as I can."

             (The scene shifts to Sir William going through the forest.)

                 Sir William: (To himself) 
                     "The forest is foreboding, but I must proceed. Our kingdom's fate is on my shoulders."

             (Eerie noises can be heard as Sir William ventures farther into the woodland. Sir William, on the other hand, remains steadfast in his pursuit of his aim.)

                     "That was close. I need to be more cautious."

                 Sir William: (Fiercely) 
                 
                     "I will never, ever submit to the likes of you, witch!"

                     "Knight, you may have won this battle, but the war is far from over!"

                 Sir William: (Heavy breathing) 
                 
                     "Get away, witch! Our kingdom will no longer accept your bad activities."

                 King Henry: 
                 
                     "Sir William, my most loyal and valiant Knight, I will be eternally grateful for your heroism. I am eternally grateful that you put your life in danger to save mine."

                 Sir William: 
                 
                     "My liege, it was my honor and duty to protect you from any peril, no matter the cost."

                 King Henry: 
                 
                     "Your acts have demonstrated that you are more than a knight; you are a true hero. As a result, I've chosen to bestow upon you a new title befitting your valor."
                     
                 Sir William:

                     "That blasted Sir William may have defeated me, but I shall not be trounced. I have powers beyond his comprehension and shall use them to wreak havoc on this land again. The Protector of the Realm, ha! He shall soon realize that his title is a meaningless symbol of his temporary triumph."

             (He runs towards the sound and finds a young woman being attacked by a group of bandits.)

                 Sir William:

                      "Fear not, for I am here to protect you. But what brings you to this part of the kingdom?"

                 Woman: 
                     
                     "I was on my way to the neighboring village to visit my sick mother. I didn't expect to run into those brigands."

                      "I see. Well, you shall not be harmed any longer. Allow me to escort you to your mother's village, and I shall ensure you arrive safely."

                 Woman: (smiling)

                 Sir William: 
                 
                      "What do you want with that old tome? And why did you disguise yourself as that woman?"
             
                 Hecate: (laughing) 
                 
                      "Oh, Sir William. You are so predictable. I came here for a powerful spell that is contained within the tome, and the woman was merely a diversion to keep you busy."
             
                 Sir William: (drawing his sword)

                 Sir William: (speaking to himself)
                 
                     "She got away. But for how long?"

                      "I must return this book to the kingdom and make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. But first, I need to find Hecate and put an end to her plans."
             
             (Suddenly, Hecate appears before him, looking more powerful than ever.)
             
                 Hecate:
                 
                      "I knew you would come for me, Sir William. But you are too late. My plans are already in motion."

                      "I have no choice. Your dark magic threatens the kingdom, and I will stop you at any cost."
         
             (Hecate unleashes a barrage of dark magic, but Sir William dodges and parries each attack with his sword.)
         
                 Sir William: (charging at Hecate)

             (Sir William takes a deep breath and charges at Hecate with renewed energy. He lands a powerful blow, but Hecate counters with a blast of dark magic that sends Sir William flying.)
         
                 Hecate:
                 
                     "You cannot defeat me, Sir William. Your sword is no match for my magic."

                 Sir William: (grunting)
                 
                     "Perhaps not, but I have one final strike left."
                 
                 Hecate: (scoffing)
                 
                     "Your final strike? How quaint. What could you possibly do?"
                 
             (Sir William takes a deep breath, gathering all his strength. He raises his sword and charges towards Hecate. As he gets closer, his sword begins to glow with a bright light.)
                 
                 Hecate: (startled)
                 
                     "What is this?"
                 
             (Sir William swings his sword with all his might, and a blinding explosion of light envelops the room. When the light fades, Hecate and Sir William are lying on the ground, motionless.)
         
         (The scene ends with the sound of a faint heartbeat, hinting at Sir William's possible survival.)
         
         
         Scene 3:
         
             (The scene opens with the kingdom in mourning for Sir William. The king addresses the crowd, looking somber.)
             
                 King:
                 
                     "Today, we lost a true hero. Sir William fought valiantly against Hecate, and though he did not emerge victorious,     he gave his life to protect our kingdom. Let us remember him always as the shining example of bravery and honor that he was."
             
             (The crowd bows their heads in respect, and the scene fades to black.)
         
                      
                      
         Bonus: 
         
             (The kingdom mourned the loss of their beloved knight, Sir William, who had fought bravely to protect the people he loved. The king himself was heartbroken and distraught over the loss of his most trusted ally. He declared a period of mourning and ordered that Sir William be given a hero's burial.)

             (But as the days went by, strange rumors began to spread throughout the land. Some claimed that they had seen Sir William, wandering the forests and protecting the kingdom from afar. Others whispered that he had been cursed by Hecate's magic, and had become something other than human.)
             
             (One day, the king received a visitor. It was a figure shrouded in a cloak, with a hood pulled low over their face. The figure spoke in a deep, rumbling voice.)
             
                 Figure:
                 
                      Your majesty, I bring news of Sir William.
             
                 King: (startled)
                 
                      Who are you? Show yourself!
             
                 Figure: (pulls back the hood, revealing the transformed Sir William)
                 
                      It is I, your majesty. Sir William.
             
                 King: (gasps)
                 
                      Sir William! What has happened to you?
             
                 Sir William: (grimly)
                 
                      Hecate's magic has transformed me, my liege. I am no longer fully human. But my heart still beats for this kingdom, and I will continue to protect it as best I can.
             
                 King: (tearfully)
                 
                      Oh, Sir William. I mourned your loss, but to see you like this...it breaks my heart.
             
                 Sir William: (resolutely)
                 
                      Do not despair, my liege. For as long as I draw breath, I will fight for this kingdom. I will protect it from all those who would seek to do it harm, no matter the cost.
             
                 The kingdom may have lost its greatest knight, but it had gained something even greater: a half-human, half-legendary protector who would continue to defend it with his life.
             
             And so the legend of Sir William lived on, shrouded in mystery and magic, but always present in the hearts of the people he had sworn to protect.
